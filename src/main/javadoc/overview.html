    Resource Path Resolver for JAX-RS.
  </p>
  <p>
    A resource entity returned from a REST resource will often contain
    links to other resources.  When a resource referenced in such a link
    is part of the same REST service, it desirable to derive the path to 
    the referenced resource using the same annotations that are used to 
    direct HTTP requests to that resource.
  </p>
  <p>
    This module provides a simple annotation-based mechanism that allows
    model builder for a resource to resolve a path to a referenced 
    resource.
